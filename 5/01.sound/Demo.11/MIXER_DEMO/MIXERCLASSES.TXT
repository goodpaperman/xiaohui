                        Audio Mixer Control Classes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New and improved...

This is a new an improved version of the Audio Mixer Control Classes. The
whole family of classes has undergone a major overhaul since this article
was first posted. Bugs have been eliminated, code reuse through inheritance
has been improved, one new class was added, and, yes, one class even
disappeared! The CMixerSelector class has been merged with the CMixerSwitch
class.

It takes quite a bit of work just to get a simple volume control to work in
an application. But with the following classes:

     CMixerFader derived from CSliderCtrl
     CMixerSwitch derived from CButton
     CMixerNumber derived from CSpinButtonCtrl (new)
     CMixerPeakMeter derived from CStatic

all it takes is a few lines of code to get several controls up and running.

For example: the CMixerFader class is derived from CSliderCtrl, so all it
takes to have a fully functional volume control is a slider control in a
dialog box, and 3 lines of code (plus the include directive!).

Coming to terms with terms

The Audio Mixer Service is made up of audio lines. An audio line can have
one or more channels (usually two for stereo).
There are two types of audio lines: Destination (output) lines, and Source
(input) lines. To every destination line is attached one or more audio
source lines. Every audio line -- either destination or source -- is
controlled by the mixer controls associated with it.

Mixer controls should not be confused with Windows controls, as they are
NOT graphical objects.

There are several types of mixer controls, the volume control being one of
them. There are also mute controls, multiple selection controls, peak
meters, just to name a few. Each audio line has certain types of mixer
controls associated with it. A mixer control can perform any number of
functions (such as control volume), depending on the characteristics of the
associated audio line.
For example, the speakers line is a destination line. It has several mixer
controls attached to it (volume, mute, bass, treble, etc.), and it has
several source lines attached to it: Line-In, Auxiliary, Synthesizer, CD
audio, etc.. In turn these source lines may have several mixer controls
attached that control their behavior.

Audio Mixer Controls

There are several families of audio mixer controls. Not all audio mixer
controls are implemented in the classes. Maybe eventually...
Here is a short description of these families, and of the mixer controls
they contain:

     Faders (Implemented by the CMixerFader class)

     Fader controls are controls that can be adjusted up or down along a
     linear scale. Their range is from 0 to 65,535. The fader family of
     controls includes the following types:
     Fader, Volume, Bass, Treble, Equalizer.

     Lists (Implemented by the CMixerSwitch class)

     List controls provide single-select or multiple-select states for
     complex audio lines. The list family of controls includes the
     following types:
     Single-select, Multiplexer (MUX), Multiple-select, Mixer.

     Meters

     Meter controls measure data passing through an audio line. Their range
     varies according to their type. The meter family of controls includes
     the following types:
     Boolean, Peak (Implemented by the CMixerPeakMeter class) , Signed,
     Unsigned.

     Numbers (Implemented by the CMixerNumber class)

     Number controls allow the user to enter numerical data associated with
     a line. The numerical data is expressed as signed integers, unsigned
     integers, or integer decibel values.

     Sliders

     Slider controls are horizontal controls that can be adjusted to the
     left or right. This type of control is not implemented by this
     package.

     Switches (implemented by the CMixerSwitch class)

     Switch controls are boolean switches. The switch family of controls
     includes the following types:
     Boolean, Button, On/Off, Mute, Mono, Loudness, Stereo Enhanced.

     Time Controls

     Time controls allow the user to enter timing-related data, such as an
     echo delay or reverberation. The time control is not implemented by
     this package.

About the classes

All the classes presented here are derived from a Windows control. They use
message reflection to handle specific messages internally. This way, the
communication between the Windows control and its associated mixer control
is taken care of inside the class.
All that is needed to get the control to work is to instantiate an object
of a given class, and to call the Init() member function specific to each
class to associate the Windows control and the mixer control.

     CMixerBase

     Base class of all the mixer classes. It takes care of opening the
     mixer device to get a valid handler. This handle, along with the
     number of channels is stored in member variables. It also tries to
     find the desired audio line. You don't use this class directly unless
     you want to derive new classes from it.

     CMixerFader

     Since this class is derived from CSliderCtrl, it allows the user to
     associate a slider control with a mixer fader control.

     CMixerSwitch

     Since this class is derived from CButton, it allows the user to
     associate a check box or radio button with a mixer switch control or
     to associate one or more CheckBoxes with a mixer selector (list)
     control. Selectors are used to select one or more input audio line
     associated with a given output line. For example, my SoundBlaster
     enables the selection of the CD audio, microphone, and line-in input
     lines associated with the speakers' output line.
     Selectors are multiple mixer controls, the number of items they
     contain is variable. Each item of the selector control is a boolean
     value. When you initialize a selector control, an appropriate internal
     table of boolean values is created. You should create as many check
     boxes or radio buttons as there are items items in the mixer list
     control. When you call Init(), the last argument passed is the index
     of the item a given button will control.

     These switches work on both channels simultaneously.

     CMixerNumber

     Since this class is derived from CSpinButtonCtrl, it allows the user
     to associate a static control with a mixer number control.

     CMixerPeakMeter

     Since this class is derived from CStatic, it allows the user to
     associate a static control with a mixer peak meter control.

     The peak meter works like the CProgressCtrl, except that it is
     vertical. It displays the audio level of the line it is associated
     with.

Which is which... and who is who!

Basically, what you have to do before using these classes, is to find out
which mixer controls are available on your system, to determine to which
destination or source line each control belongs to, and to determine which
class implements a given mixer control.

To find out which types of audio lines and controls are available on your
system, I have included a utility function you can use to determine the
capabilities of your sound card and the available audio services. Its
header file is MixerInfo.h, and its impementation file is MixerInfo.cpp.
The function name is GetDevicesInfo(), and it takes as argument a filename
for logging the results of the query.
I recommend you use it before doing anything else. It will list all
available destination lines, and the source lines attached to every
destination line. It will also list all the controls attached to a given
line. The information is arranged in a tree-like structure:

Destination Line 0

     List of Controls ...
     Source Line 0
          List of Controls ...
     Source Line 1
          List of Controls ...
     Source Line 2
          List of Controls ...

Destination Line 1

     List of Controls ...
     Source Line 0
          List of Controls ...
     Source Line 1
          List of Controls ...

etc...

For every available line, note the "Line type" information. It corresponds
to the DstType and SrcType parameters of the Init() member function.
For every available control, note the "Control type" information. It
corresponds to the ControlType parameter of most of the Init() member
functions.

The supplied Demo Project has a special dialog ( CInfoDlg class ) that
displays the same information in a tree control. Just click on an item in
the tree to display some information on it.

                                  MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_STEREOENH

 CMixerNumber                     MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_UNSIGNED

 CMixerPeakMeter                  MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_PEAKMETER

There's nothing like a little example...

Implementing a speaker volume control:

First of all, add the "MixerFader.h" header file and the MixerFader.cpp
source file to your project, include the header file where necessary, and
REMEMBER to link with winmm.lib

     Note: the other files are: MixerClasses.h (which includes all other
     class headers),
     MixerBase.h, MixerPeakMeter.h, MixerNumber.h, MixerSwitch.h,
     MixerBase.cpp, MixerPeakMeter.cpp, MixerNumber.cpp, and
     MixerSwitch.cpp

In resource editor, add a slider control and give it a meaningful ID, say
IDC_MAIN_VOLUME.

Now you have two choices: either use DDE to create and associate a variable
of type CMixerFader with the slider control, or subclass the slider
control. object.

     With DDE: the problem is that ClassWizard will not recognize class
     CMixerFader as a valid type for associating with the control, because
     it doesn't know about it. To solve this problem, delete your .clw file
     from your project directory. Then, invoke Class Wizard. It will
     complain that it cannot find its database file and ask you if you want
     to create it from your source files. Click yes, and in the dialog box
     that appears, you'll see that it lists all your source files. Click
     OK.
     Now, in Class Wizard, select the Member Variables tab. Select your
     dialog class from the Class Name combo box. In the list of control
     IDs, select the ID of your slider control, and click on Add
     Variable... Type a name for your variable, say m_mainVolume. Select
     CMixerFader from the Variable Type combo box and click OK.
     That's it! For now...

     With subclassing: in your CDialog-derived class, add a member variable
     of type CMixerFader, say m_mainVolume. Go to your dialog class'
     OnInitDialog() member function (add one with Class Wizard if you don't
     have one). There, add this line after the call to
     CDialog::OnInitDialog():

     m_mainVolume.SubclassDlgItem( IDC_MAIN_VOLUME, this );

Ok, now you have to initialize your CMixerFader object. For this, you call
CMixerFader::Init() from OnInitDialog(); like this:

     m_mainVolume.Init( MIXERLINE_COMPONENTTYPE_DST_SPEAKERS,//destination line
                        NO_SOURCE, //control is attached to destination line only
                        MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_VOLUME, //control type
                        CMixerFader::MAIN );

The first argument to Init() is the destination line you want. The
speakers' line is an ouput line, and its type is
MIXERLINE_COMPONENTTYPE_DST_SPEAKERS.
The second argument to Init() is the source line you want. Since the main
volume is not attached to a source line, we specify NO_SOURCE (if you
wanted to create a volume control for, say, the cd audio source line, this
argument would have been MIXERLINE_COMPONENTTYPE_SRC_COMPACTDISC).
The third argument is the type of control you want to use. Since you want a
volume control, you specify MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_VOLUME. Init() will
query the mixer device to find out if there actually is a volume control
for this type of line. If the query is successful, Init() returns 1;
otherwise, it returns 0. These first three arguments are specific to the
Audio Mixer services, but the last argument (SubType) is there because on a
stereo audio line you might want to create a main volume that controls both
channels, or create a balance control to fade out the left or right
channel, or create two sliders to control the channels separately. For each
of these cases, the arguments would be respectively: CMixerFader::MAIN,
CMixerFader::BALANCE, CMixerFader::LEFT, and CMixerFader::RIGHT.

That's it, you're done! To check if everything went OK, compile and run
your program, and start the system's Volume Control (from the System Tray).
You should see both main volume sliders work in conjunction.

Creating controls using the other classes is very similar. See their
implementation source file for more details on how to use their Init()
function.

Don't lose sight of the view

If you want to use a volume control in a view for example, you dont call
SubclassDlgItem of course. In your CView-derived class declaration, declare
a member variable of type CMixerFader, and in your view class' OnCreate(),
create the windows control by calling CSliderCtrl::Create().
Like this for example:

     m_mainVolume.Create( WS_VISIBLE|TBS_VERT|TBS_BOTH|TBS_NOTICKS,
                          CRect(10,100, 30,200), this, IDC_MAIN_VOLUME);

     m_mainVolume.Init( MIXERLINE_COMPONENTTYPE_DST_SPEAKERS,
                        NO_SOURCE,
                        MIXERCONTROL_CONTROLTYPE_VOLUME, //control type
                        CMixerFader::MAIN );

     NOTE: Because the CMixerFader objects use message reflection to detect
     slider movements, you have to be aware that if the parent window class
     has a handler for the WM_HSCROLL or WM_VSCROLL message, and if the
     base class handler is not called from that handler, the scrolling
     messages will not be sent back to the controls.
     Also, be aware that CFrameWnd and derived classes have a default
     handler for scrolling events, so a CMixerFader won't work in such a
     window. One way to circumvent this is to call ReflectLastMsg from the
     handler before you do your normal processing:

     void CMyView::OnVScroll(UINT nSBCode, UINT nPos, CScrollBar* pScrollBar)
     {
         ReflectLastMsg( pScrollBar->GetSafeHwnd() );

         // blah, blah, blah...
     }

...and a little demo!

You can download a new Demo Project that implements most of the
functionality of the system's Volume Control (the one that pops up when you
double click on the little speaker on the Task Bar). The main window is an
empty dialog box used only to enclose child dialogs. When the user selects
an item from the 'View' menu, a new dialog is displayed as a child of the
main dialog (in the client area), which resizes to accomodate the child.
Three child dialogs are defined: one for playback controls, one for
recording controls, and one for voice controls. Check their implementation
files (SpeakerDlg.pp, WaveDlg.cpp, VoiceDlg.cpp) to get a feel of how work
with the classes.

When you start the program, it may tell you that certain mixer controls
were not found and that the corresponding Windows control will be disabled.
This is normal, because which controls are found depends on the drivers
installed. This is not critical though. You just won't be able to use
certain controls. In fact, the demo tries on purpose to create a balance
control for the microphone source line. On NT, it triggers a warning, but
when I switch OS to Windows 95, it works.
The demo has a "Device Info" command, which calls GetDeviceInfo() to query
the capabilities of your system, and then launches Notepad to display the
log file.
It also has a "Device Caps" command, which displays an explorer-like dialog
box. The tree control displays the hierarchy of available mixer lines and
controls. Click on any item to see information about it.

If you prefer, you can also download the classes' source code only.

Both the Demo and Source Zip file contain a file named MixerClasses.txt, a
text version of this page.

These classes will work on Windows95 or NT only.
The code was written with Developer Studio 97 and VC++ 5.0 with MFC 4.21

Thanks to Keith Rule for his CMemDC class, which I use to draw the
CMixerPeakMeter flicker-free.

Comments, suggestions and, yes, even bug reports are more than welcome!
