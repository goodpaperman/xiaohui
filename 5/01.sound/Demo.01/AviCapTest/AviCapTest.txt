// Additional notes about AviCap class

This class was successfully tested with follow capture devices:

1. VideoBlaster RT300 (in-cheap Intel Indeo codec).
  The driver of this device works strange: it returns compressed buffer although the bitmap header was as for "uncompressed" image. After testing with this device a special protected member  _IsImageCompressed() was added.
2. Videotizer  by DARIM Vision Co., Ltd. It works correctly.EnumValidFrameSize returns the available formats list which is the same as "public"(from driver dialog). This driver has 2-4 internal buffer.
3. ATI All-in-Wonder(with TV input). Everything OK.
4. ASUS V3000 (with TV input). EnumValidFrameSize returns the available formats list which rather differents with "public"(from driver dialog)! You can setup all of them, but the doesn't works!
The main lack with this driver - it uses non-standard frame sizes (352x288??).

Please, E-Mail me about yours results.
